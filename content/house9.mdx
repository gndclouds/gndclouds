house is a project from o.0 (oh dot zero) focused on the long-term dwelling of humans on earth. Phase one is a year long research phase looking at how to decentralize all public utilities. Currently we are working with [Utopia 竊余(https://utopia.so/), [Stone Edge Micro-grid 竊余(https://sefmicrogrid.com/), and [Center for Art and Public Life 竊余(https://portal.cca.edu/essentials/center-arts-and-public-life/) at [California College of the Arts 竊余(https://cca.edu/) to bring this into the world.

What do we mean by "decentralize all public utilities"? Well today if you want water, power, waste, or communication to be available at you home you need to connect to your cities or counties utility grid. We are researching a future in which you can be separated from that grid system. This may sound a bit like a micro-grid but thinking even smaller. Our focus is on what we are calling the pico grid, or a grid that can service all traditional public utility needs of one household. To achieve this we are working to develop a "core" which would maintain and manage all you utilities.

    We will research the feasibility of the pico-grid and gain a better
    understanding of how we can build for impact. With a focus on new urban
    construction in expanding metropolitian areas.

    Now that we have a better understanding of the market we need to ground our
    pico-grid. This will mark the beginning of our concepting phase in which we
    look for the best methods to apply our findings to modifying existing
    infrastructures while we build new ones.
