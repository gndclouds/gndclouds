This report looked at the broader view of online education in terms of degrees and certificate programs that are currently available. The institution included a range of ed-tech startups, nonprofits, and traditional college and universities. You can view a summery of the research bellow or checkout the [database of the 64 institutions researched here](https://www.notion.so/ab7e10741b5b4a59b4a2d352e8562eeb?v=cbf781769dd8499eab2ebc823acab761).

# **Definitions**

**Tools** - There is a growing number of online tools focused on creating the next best online IDE through freemium experiences. Many of these platform like GitHub, CodePen, [Now.sh](http://now.sh/), and Glitch offer free learn to code courses on their platform to promote its use.

**Academia** - Many large or well-known _colleges_ and _universities_ now have their course catalogs, and degree programmes offered online. However, their offerings ramin broad and nontopical. For example, you can find Computer Science degrees that focus on Machine Learning. But the degree is still Computer Science whereas _platforms_ and _tools_ break up their offerings by Job type like Machine Learning for Self Driving Cars or React for Designers.

**Boot Camps** - Many boot camps are focused on quick learning often in person or for a set/scheduled time for group practice.

**Platforms** - Here are a series of emergent websites that are focused on providing alternative forms of education. These can be nonprofits, or for profits, they are just focused on creating spaces for others to learn — either through the creation of their content and or the sourcing of content with partners.

**Other** - The research called out a few outliers that did not fit into a more traditional bucket but felt worth including as they are still part of the larger ed-tech market.

# Prices

There is a ton of pricing options out there; overall there are three main buckets, freemium, lifetime access, and term based.

**Freemium** - This is by far the most common form out there. You can often try out a course or pay for different terms depending on how much support you need in completing the course. This model is most common for learning to code and design courses but its quickly spreading to other disciplines.

**Lifetime access** - There are lots of mom and pop / one-off tutorials out there and many our pay once for lifetime access, the is some time and othertime not updated depending on the community.

**Terms** - This is used by large universities or college, which feel like a relic pricing model. It leaves very little flexibility and will most likely start to die out over the next decade. It's just not a sustainable way to create access to education.
