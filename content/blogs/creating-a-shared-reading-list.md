For a while, I have wanted to create a social reading list to share notes, links, comments, and highlights with friends at a new conversational pace.

There are existing tools in this space, Hypothesis, collective network, and even Twitter to name a few.

But non-strike the [pace of conversation](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Pace-layering-for-communication-and-messaging--A_AGMqTduRXMy7nq4vEfpi6_Ag-6MiaurO6u6l9g9SDkqO8O) that enables passive to active asynchronous communication to take place. To start, the goal is just to save links to a group feed of some sort. Then from there expand little by little with tiny experiments.

## v0 built for friends

&nbsp;

To start all I'm trying to do is create a web extension that allows you to **⌘ + B** and save the link from the current page to a public feed. Then when clicking on the extension icon you can see the feed of links that you and others have saved. (Eventually, this would also be a website.) Ideally, I would love for this to work on safari, but perhaps Chrome + Firefox would make more sense to start with since the [Safari WebApp JS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariextensions) support is very new.
&nbsp;

**v0 goals:**
&nbsp;

- Save links with **⌘ + B**
- Links are visible on the website
- Links feed is visible in the web extension as pop-up
  &nbsp;

## v1+ for the Public:

&nbsp;

Would love to start with an invite-only role out to build a strong community based on friends of friends. Then when it's stable determine what a basic payment model would be and open it up to the public, while grandfathering the initial group in for free.
&nbsp;

**v1+ goals:**
&nbsp;

- Invite only
- Save link to Private feed with **⌘ + B + Shift**
- Basic [spacial commenting]()
- Follow and unfollow community members
