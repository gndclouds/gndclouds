The first information system I had was in high school when I mostly tracked my work in [Evernote](http://web.archive.org/web/20110202144520/http://evernote.com/) and Finder. <!-- excerpt -->The structure was heavily encouraged as part of my Theory of common knowledge course and an article by Steven Johnson called [_The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book_](https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book-639b16c4f3bb?gi=211f4fb59654). The first strucutre I implomented was to group files realted to People, Places, or Things. Then I would have tags help me filter to more topic-based categories like IB Biology, or exam notes. Lastly, I used colors to indicate some form of action shown in the key below.

**File Structure:**

- Save everything to Evernote, articles, books, inspirational iamges, notes, papers, etc.
- Main parent folders started with OrgName.Subtopic and then the first child was typically a year

**Tags:**

- Course Names
- Subject (Ethics, Theater, Etc)
- Conent Type (Exam, Paper, Notes)

**v1 Color Key:**

- ðŸŸ¦ Look up or check reference
- ðŸŸ¨ Save this
- ðŸŸ¥ Safe to Delete
