This year my focus has shifted to doing projects that amplify my learning and help me rebuild my creative confidence. In the spirit of this I have been looking at setting up a small online store and wanted to research what some of the best options are for indie makers.

| [Wix]()             |       —       |                \$17/mo. |
| [Weebly]()          |       —       |       \$8/mo. + 3%/sale |
| [ZipSell]()         |       —       |    \$7/mo. + 2.9% + 30¢ |
| [VPRS (Zeit)]()     |       —       |              2.9% + 30¢ |
| [Big Cartel]()      |       —       |               \$9.99/mo |
| [Volusion]()        |       —       |                \$15/mo. |
| [Foxycart]()        |       —       |     \$20/mo. + 15¢/sale |
| [E-junkie]()        |       —       |                 \$5/mo. |
| [SendOwl]()         |       —       |                  \$9/mo |
| [3dcart]()          |       —       |                9.99/mo. |

From what I can tell the best starting points are [Zeits VPRS]() and [ZipSell](). Partly beacse they both use Stripe, and they are both pretty quick to get working if you have some technical experience. But if want to use a GUI the entire way the Small Victories is a reasobable starting pint.
