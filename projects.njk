<p>Notes are a way for me to think in public about what I'm learning and new areas of interest. Some of my current mental threads are keeping <a href="/logs/">[📮 Learning Logs]</a>, <a href="/dev/">[Dev Notes]</a>, <a href="/climate/">[🌻 Climate Research]</a>, and some <a href="/experiments/">[⚗️ Experiments]</a>.</p>
