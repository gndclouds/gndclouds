For a few months, I have wanted to research the [invisible infrastructure](https://ii.gndclouds.cc) which surrounds us in daily life. I want to call attention to all the things we no longer see and the things so common that they have become expectations within society. The end of is very unknown so for now I'm launching an alpha site that will have a gallery of examples and a home for a newsletter sign up to start. Maybe when enough research is collected I can turn it into a blog, podcast, book, or brand of some sort.
