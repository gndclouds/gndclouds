The Current Slate v1 Account Settings Page has several save buttons for different sections. So to get introduced to the backend I'm going to work on connecting each of them into one function. Then After that I will move them into a single function which checks for when key stop, to then trigger a save event.

My current thinking is that it might look something like:

```
WaitForUserInputToStop[
 // Wait for input for keystrokes to stop
Then call SaveAll()
]
SaveAll function [ // connect to save button
_handleSaveFilecoin()
_handleSaveBio()
]
```

Will update with the actual implementation

```javascript

```
