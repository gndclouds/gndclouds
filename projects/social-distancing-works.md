I had just left the US as cases were starting to spike and was amazed at the lack of masks and distancing taking the place. Masks had not been commonplace in America unless you lived near wildfires. So we created a small site called [Social Distancing Works](https://socialdistancing.works) which allows you to place an illustrated mask over an image for your social media profile. The hope was that we could spread awareness to encourage the use of masks among groups of the population who hadn't typically been exposed to mask culture.


At the time this was the most traffic any project I had helped make has ever gotten with it getting around 4k views on its peak day and around 14k total views over the following year from 2020 to 2021.
