Over the course of eight weeks with the City of San Francisco's Department of Public Health our team mapped the Medi-Cal enrollment process for homeless in San Francisco Country.

## Field Guide
![Field Guide Preview]()
We created a field guide for the new role which summarized our research and best practices for enrolling housing-insure people in Medi-Cal. The [Field Guide](https://sf-wpc.gitbooks.io/fieldguide/content/) is public and available on GitBook.
&nbsp;

## Mapping Services
As part of our research we conducted 42 interviews with various medical service groups which handled Medi-Cal enrollment. Then after identifying the three main entry points, we created service blueprints to understand were "falling off" the Medi-Cal system.
