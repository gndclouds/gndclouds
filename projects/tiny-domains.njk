<p>There is a chance that in 2021 we will see another internet boom based on dome new tools and frameworks from the decentralized web community. One way Tiny Factories is participating in the space is by purchasing and hosting domains as a way to fund our research. TinyDomains shows which domains we are selling and how we might use the fund to help us with out work and help the planet.
