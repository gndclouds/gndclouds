At Speechify, I templatized a more consistent a rigorous research practice with the core team and support staff in order to gain better and more reliable feedback from customers. It consisted of writing templates for research guides, guidelines on scheduling, methods for conducting interviews, and best ways to maintain and follow up with interviewees. Then I started to look at new ways to enhance the product development cycle by incorporating research into the design and development pipeline. We then used these tools to create a more consistent group of beta testers for testing a new onboarding flow and uploading process. On occasion, I would provide supplemental design work when needed.

My work was paralleled by some additional research around trends and competition analysis. As Speechify determined the best direction for future growth. You can read each report below, please note that a few sections of internal metrics have been removed.
