Hey I’m Will,

My day-to-day focus is making things for the planet, sometimes as a designer and sometimes as a developer. My next big project focuses on shifting our collective means of consumption into practices that allow humanity to become better planetary stewards. While periodically thinking about tea.
Last Year, I co-founded Anthropogenic, which was building a new system of accountability, through verification and monitoring, for financial institutions in preparation for pending regulations around emissions reporting.

I co-run a community ↗ ,called [Tiny Factories](url), of creatives, consisting of indiepreneurs, coders, artists, designers, musicians, videographers, writers, animators (and more) who are working to support each other in establishing both creative autonomy and financial stability. This space allows me to tinker with smaller ideas to keep my creative thoughts flowing in a way that is not always sustainable at work.
In the before times, I worked as a design technologist at research labs across all types of companies. In these roles, I translated emerging technologies into prototypes in which the core tech was abstracted away so that we could focus on the intended function.

At the start, I was at [California College of the Arts](url) ↗ pursuing a BFA in Interaction Design ↗.
