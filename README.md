## Indiepreneuring at [Tiny Factories](https://tinyfactories.space)

Recent work has focused on building small tools for the indie web through [Tiny Factories] and climate research projects with [oh dot zero]. I have chosen to grow generalist skills across research, design, and development while becoming a specialist in specific topics like distributed biomimetic systems, software that enables user agency, and climate research.

## Spaces of thought

My curiosity drives me to learn, read, and write. This blog is about a reflection of my mind and the mental threads I have been thinking about.

## Across the Internet

I'm working on connecting more projects and platforms to [my site](https://gndclouds.cc) but not everything is connected yet. So here are some other places I exist on the internet.
