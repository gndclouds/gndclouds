A new school for ecology

I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can help with climate change. Part of my thinking occasionally results in short articles which you can follow with RSS or on amonthly basis via my newsletter.

It’s really exciting to see the next new tools that are emerging for the next generation of makers, designers, and developers. A lot of my foundational skills for building physical things still stems from my foundation craft and shop classes in college who is currently building a new off the grid campus will wonderful new shops.

I was introduced to ecology and how to build it into to my practice as a freshman but only because I sough out those courses. But it we are to prepare the current and next generation for the climate expo which is quickly approaching then we must set the standard in school that the only way is to build with eco materials or developed new ones.

One of the main building material in school was foam board, spray adhesive, ink, cardboard, Masonite, and wood.

Alternatives ...

I look forward to seeing the new campus and squatting in the labs and cafe when I need to feel the energy of pure creation which I have only ever found in a college lab or shop. But we need to be more critical of the materials we use to build the future we want to see and the future we need to survive.
