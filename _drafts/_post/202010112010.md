What if the notion of a playlist existed at the OS level?

For example, I could queue up a few podcasts, then some music, and end with an audiobook or collection of articles from my RSS feed.

This could allow for a new method for Siri to construct suggestions where instead of recommending common tasks they produced a playlist of actions with a tree diagram structure when user patterns are less clear.
