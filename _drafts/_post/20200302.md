For context, there are a lot of amazing open-source hardware keyboards, computers, cameras, and more. But sourcing all the parts (especially when getting started) is kinda hard and expensive since most PCB makers have 3-100 board minimums. So I want to make it easier for people to start making and level up the design of the hardware kits along the way.

So today I made some wireframes and started making the landing page. Last week I sourced the material for the first kit. And later this week I'm looking to render the products in Blender.
