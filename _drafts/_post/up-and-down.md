files for work i have been migratinf open data sets ro our platform abs find tile traphenr to be crazy 

As part of my work I upload open source data sets to our servoce, Slate, to both test out variouse systems and showcase the futures we imagine. Typically this requires me to download several gigs a day of data, to just upload it to Slate. This got me thinking about how there must be a siftware engineer or data science posation who specializes in migrating and maintainign larfe data sets. (Please dm me if you know what this carrer is called.)

Thinking more on this space I wondered how much more effiecnt itnwould be for us to goback to thr world of thinclients. Espically now that we have such fast mobile devices and internet connextions. 


Some open queations this left me woth are:
- what would happen if we centeralozed 80% of our computing power ans streamed the data to clients? would we save that much computational power? shoudltn that be what the internet is for? how is the cirrebt internet support ans not support this model?

is thr ossue around protocalls?

for my use case today i was downlading data from a server in SF to mu comouter in TPE and then uploadinf thr data to a portland, and then the data was being backedup in china, europe, and america ðŸ¤­ 

this feels far from ideal

i typically push for decenteralized systems as much as incan but this instance has me thinging. whay is better and why?

- Fewer centeralized servers whicj stream whats happening to client we have while the real computational worj haplend on a server 

- More decernteralized systmes whuch break up big tasks into smalllwr ones but dont rely on a centerakzied systme 

inthink i thins answered my own questions


so how could my issue be solved in a decernteralized way?

- once i downlaod the files incan make them againle in taiwan?
- incould rewuest sf sends the data ti portland server?




For most some work its much morenorwxtical for me to have the representation of s file but todo the process or alterations to the fike remotly
