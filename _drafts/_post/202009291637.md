Something that I adore about wandering through cities is seeing an example of how all space is used. One soft spot I have is for tiny structures, like the one shown in the image above, that makes use of all the remaining space. Some day I would love to purchase a few of these buildings across the world and offer them to friends, family, and [indiepreneur](https://indiepreneur.wiki) as they get off the ground.
