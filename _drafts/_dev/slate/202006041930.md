Currently, there are two methods I was thinking of trying to implement for inline numbers.

Option 1: Create a table with two columns. Make the table as long as the col 2 which would contain the <code> and then have increment a variable at each row in column 1.

Option 2: Create two div objects named <pre> and <code>. Count the number of lines in <code> and have a for loop which adds appends that a number in <pre> for every line in <code>.

If you have another way in mind please feel free to dm me! 🙇🏻‍♂️
