To cover some of the unknowns of creating an application with a frontend and backend I went through a tutorial on [Creating Web Apps with NextJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-node-nextjs-fullstack-multi-user-blogging-platform-with-seo/learn/). Although it wasn’t completely aligned with what I needed it highlighted some wonderful things which I hadn’t implemented before. One of the really fun parts was getting back into server stuff and configuring [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/). Which I haven’t done since high school.
