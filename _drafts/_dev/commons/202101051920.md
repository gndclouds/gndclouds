I have been thinking about allowing members to sort and label the links they save to the commons. The current thinking is that each member can have collections ( like folders) that would be local or unique to your individual account. Then there would be global tags which would be the same across all saved links. The basic version of this works without the local versus global permissions. But I need to learn more about how to store the schema in the database before I can make collections unique to each member.
