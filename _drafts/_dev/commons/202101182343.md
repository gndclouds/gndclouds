![WIP image for 202101182343](/img/dev/202101182343.mov)

Small updates today, you can now title your links, and tomorrow I will start to add in tag and search support. But for now, you can save links and then click on them to take you back to the original article. The template which I started with is [nextjs-mongodb-app](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app). Would highly recommend you check it out if you're looking to build a feed-based app with user auth!
