In an early build of [are.na](http://are.na/) you could click on the channel name to edit it. I always found this to be a wonderful feature that removed unnecessary clicking, even tho it was a very hidden affordable. So I implemented something inspired by that notion. When you click the page title in the navigation bar you can enter any path you might want to go to. In the example here, I enter 'books' and am taken to my collection of book notes. But this is mostly intended for me to quickly jump around my site. It could be interesting to have it default to a search query or internet archive lookup if the entered path is not valid.
