I'm pretty excited about a conversation with all of the tiny garden members this past week. And I have been thinking a lot about what it would mean to create a co-op style community. I wanted to drop down some thoughts to share them with you here in the hopes that they can create a foundation that was shared with the larger community as we figure out what this next transition looks like for the tiny garden.

# Transitioning

Some thoughts on how we can get from where we are not to where we would love to be:

- Create a collection of [tasks](https://www.notion.so/tinyfactories/A-Tiny-Co-op-58fb472eb52241c8af2b3e81b0fb8887#1bb4eb4f144a4761be574ad607030a31)
- Craft a message to the existing group about the transaction or migration of the group.
- How do we create start to loop people into even this document.
- Guidelines for entering and leaving the group

# Governance

- How do we select new members
- How do we onboard new members
- Is there a trial period
- How do we distribute groups tasks

# Finances

- How do funds get spent?
- How do we collect and when?
- How do we make funds transpatent? (I feel like this should be a two party system. For example we vote on when funds get spent)

# Group Representation

- How do members want to be represented on the site?
- How can we work as a group on projects?
- How is credit communicated for group project in relation to tiny factories
- What types of information do we want to share publicly and privately?
    - New letter
    - Zine
    - Profiles
    - group chats
    - group working calls
- How can we increase the diversity

# A Online Co-op would mean

- Shared group funds
- Max number of people
- Share brand to leverage
- Community to get support and feedback from
- Voting to make decisions
    - Small decisions can be emoji-reaction voted
    - Big decisions can be through online forms and a few days
