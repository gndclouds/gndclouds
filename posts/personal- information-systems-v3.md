# Highlighting
For years I have tried to make use if hilighing bur its never really taken. In part because it always felt random and there wasnt a clear way for me to filter information across the software I use. So two improvements Im tryinf oir are:

1- a key for what diferenxr colirs mean 

2- a workflow for saving things which I clip ans highlight from across digital meidia [to one place])clips.gndclouds.cc).

v3 key:

🟦 - Look up or check reference 
🟩 - 
🟨 - Save this
🟥 - Safe to Delete
