_This article was backdated to represent when I started a personal information system._

The first information system I had was in high school when I mostly tracked my work in [Evernote](http://web.archive.org/web/20110202144520/http://evernote.com/) and Finder. The structure was heavily encouraged as part of my Theory of common knowledge course and an article by Steven Johnson called [_The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book_](https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book-639b16c4f3bb?gi=211f4fb59654). The first strucutre I implomented was to group files realted to People, Places, or Things. Then I would have tags help me filter to more topic-based categories like IB Biology, or exam notes. Lastly, I used colors to indicate some form of action shown in the key below.

**File Structure:**

+ Save everything to Evernote, articles, books, inspirational iamges, notes, papers, etc.
+ Main parent folders started with OrgName.Subtopic and then the first child was typically a year


**Tags:**

+ Course Names
+ Subject (Ethics, Theater, Etc)
+ Conent Type (Exam, Paper, Notes)

**v1 Color Key:**

 + ðŸŸ¦ Look up or check reference  
 + ðŸŸ¨ Save this
 + ðŸŸ¥ Safe to Delete
