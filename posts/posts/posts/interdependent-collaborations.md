Interdependent Collaborations 

In any context collaborating with anyone can be difficult when there is a lack of shared understanding around the collobration. We have been building and shipping project since 2019 at Tiny Factories and I wanted to relfect on some principle which I have been actily thinking about regarding what makes a collobration sucessfull. 


In principle I think the notion of working with others on project is great. But the process of finding the right people can be really difficult, even when everyone has good intentions going into the project. Based on our current skill set and small team size I think collaborators need to be able to work with us in some of the following ways:





**Independent** - The abuility takeon ownership of a task, and find the best solution within thier means.  

- Commitment 
- Complementary communication skills  
- Accountably 
- Constructively blunt 
- A teacher

** A student **  
Can ask questions or advice from team


Maybe this will act as a template for a future in which we become a co-op.

Leveraging prilivage

I’m very lucky to be able to stay in Taiwan, at a time when most of the world feels so uneasy at the moment (202006).

Make sure do give prilivage to others when possible. 


Entropic visions 
Learning about the past of something to know how to inform its futures while conciserinf its projected be it its abs consequences. 


Suspending ...
Ability to look at a problem and understand why it’s the way it is even if it conflicts with personal values.
