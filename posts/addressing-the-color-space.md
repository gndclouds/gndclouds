For years I only interacted with color in a 2-dimensional context. By choosing a color swatch for a wall, picking a background color in a presentation, or highlighting text in a book.<!-- excerpt --> Then in college, many of my design tools started to have a new color picker with much more complexity. We are going to call this new interface the color cube.
