One of the joys of building [Tiny Factoreis](https://tinyfactories.space) has been working with different tiny teams of people to build and ship projects. The more projects we have worked on the better I feel about gauging what is needed for us to make the collaboration successful. I wanted to summarize some of the principles that have become most helpful from our past collaborations:
<br/>
**Independent** - The ability to take on ownership of a task, and find the best solution within their means.
<br/>

**Commitment** - You know that no matter what they will be there with you until the end shipping even if it takes some late nights.
<br/>

**Complimentary** - Most of the time we have multiple projects happening at once, and it's often helpful when there is some overlap in skill. This way when one person gets a little to busy the other team member can help keep progressing the project.
<br/>

**Constructively blunt** - There is a working understanding that when anyone provides feedback it's direct, but polite and non aimed at making anyone feel bad.
<br/>

**A teacher** - Can share what they know with others and teach new things they pick up throughout the project without ego being present.
<br/>

**A student** - Can ask questions or advice from the team when they are stuck after seeking their solution to the problem.
<br/>

**Rational Obsessions** - We will make space for rabbit holes of knowledge exploration, and obsess over the details that matter most to each of our team members.
<br/>

**Always be Riffing** - The exchange of building on each other's ideas should feel so fluent that in the end, you don't remember who thought of the original idea.
<br/>

This list will grow and flux over time but currently, it's a v1 of sorts. I will periodically update it as we learn new things about how to make joyful things together.
