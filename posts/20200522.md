One of the original motivations for [Tiny Factories](tinyfactories.space) was looking at a shared earnings agreement between the members. The thinking was that if you could remove the initial financial burden of launching a project for motivated individuals, we could all mutually benefit while doing the work we love. Recently this thinking changed a little after listening to [a podcast by Bay Curiouse](https://www.breaker.audio/bay-curious/e/63844889) about how Co-op bakeries work in the San Francisco Bay Area.So something we might want to explore is looking into if a co-op/share earnings agreement hybrid would be the best approach.
