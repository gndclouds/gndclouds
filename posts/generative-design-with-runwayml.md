My motivation for becoming an interaction designer was rooted in wanting to help us have better relations ships with the object we craft both digitally and phyicsll. Most of my recent for has constuned to use my design knowledge but the increased focus has been to beuild more technical capacity with in myself. This motivation is heavuly conneted to the kneldge hat people machine collobration will continy to become more ubiquisiouse.

Today we are a ways from the harmoney and agency I would like to see in tools. But For the last few weeks I have started to use [runwayml]() for some generative design excerises. Ciurrentl there is still a battier to knowing what ML does to get the most out of thier tooling. But I wanted ot share a bit about my workflow today.

Many of my experiemnts have been around training a model to make more of a ceritan type of image. For exmple I give a computer 100 images of a fish and then tell it to learn what makes a fish a fish. Then I come back after a few hours and ask it to make me 5000 new fishes.

Finding Data

If we want to train a computer we need to give it some data. The models I have been experiemnting with are stypically betwren 100-500 iamges. But if possible I woudl recommend you start with 1000 minimum.

As an exmple we are going to create a SANGAN2 model around graidnents.
