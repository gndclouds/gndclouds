Field notes on infrastructure, urban planning, and architecture details from the streets of Taiwan.

Taiwan gets about 120 in (3000 mm) of rainfall each year. So the rivers have high embankments to channel stormwater to the ocean. Many have a mix of greenery and seating areas built-in.

Taipei and its suburbs have a lot of biking infrastructure. Most main road have raised and dedicated bike lanes next to the sidewalk.

Some alleys are very narrow with asphalt stretching from building to building. Often, youâ€™d find a collection of small planters along the alleys making more green space.
