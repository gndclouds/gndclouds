Since I have been wanting to make more work in public, I thought it could be good to do so by working on an open-source piece of software. Today I started working on a project called [Slate](https://slate.host/), which is currently part of the [FileCoin](https://filecoin.io/) ecosystem. I'm hoping to learn more about the best software engineering practices since I tend to operate in a design first mindset. Specifically, the methods used to architect a system, communicate async with a team and work on the full stack (eventually).
