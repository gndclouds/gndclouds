The first version works! I'm still rather new to React so this version is just written in vanilla.js. The `js` is pretty simple, which makes me curious why you don't see this implemented more frequently. But I'm also guessing there is a cleaner way that doesn't rely on `line-height`.

Next, it porting it to React ü§ûüèª, but you can play with the vanilla.js version on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/~codeblock).

```javascript
function countLines() {
  var codeBlock = document.getElementById("content");
  var divHeight = codeBlock.offsetHeight;
  var lineHeight = parseInt(codeBlock.style.lineHeight);
  var lines = divHeight / lineHeight;

  console.log(lines);
  for (var i = 1; i < lines; i++) {
    const lineNumber = document.createElement("p");
    lineNumber.classList.add("numbers");
    lineNumber.innerText = i + ".";

    const lineNumbersDiv = document.getElementById("linenumbers");
    lineNumbersDiv.insertAdjacentElement("beforeend", lineNumber);
  }
}
```
