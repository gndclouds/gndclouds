# Newsletter

A newsletter from gndclouds delivered on a monthly-ish basis.

Hey, welcome to the newsletter. I tend to not write much at the moment and wanted to make a way to keep friends, family, and collaborators in the loop. My goal is to have this be a different pace of conversation, one thatâ€™s slower than Twitter, but faster than my typical noteging pace. The structure I want to experiment with over time but the current starting categories of thought organization will be Learnings, Conversation (coming next issue), Creations, and Recommendations. So here we go.
