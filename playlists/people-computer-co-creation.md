_A playlist is a collection of examples to quickly onboard to a concept. _

A lot of why I became an interaction designer was to understand the technical systems which support humanity. But more frequently than not I find that capitalism tends to sway us from the most human implementation of new technologies. Here I have some examples and my writing around how I'm defining the space of People Computer Co-creation. The intent is that the work here can help inform the next generation of Interaction Designers to stop making screens and start designing the rules governing the algorithms of tomorrow.

## Playlist

Demonstrations of new technology often focus on direct application and not the systemic changes a technology affords. This channel's goal is to catalog examples of people machine co-creation so that we can be more intentional about how we apply new technologies.
