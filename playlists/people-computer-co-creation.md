A lot of why I became an interaction designer was to understand the technical systems which support humanity. But more frequently than not I find that capitalism tends to sway us from the most human implementation of new technologies. Here I have some examples and my writing around how I'm defining the space of People Computer Co-creation. The intent is that the work here can help inform the next generation of Interaction Designers to stop making screens and start designing the rules governing the algorithms of tomorrow.
