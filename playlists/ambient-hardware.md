# Overview
With the increased accessibility of home automation by the use of mainstream IoT products and the [squad + community]() isolation, I have started to explore new methods of ways to use hardware to explore connectedness. The range of how ambient hardware is defined is rather wide-ranging as seen in [these exameles](https://www.are.na/gndclouds/ambient-hardware). 



##Range of ambient hardware

examples 
- berg availibot
- teal
- big bang iot connected bots 


## Current experiments 

## future writing:
- methods of ambiance (sounds, movement, light, display, acustor(open window))
- groups size or squad size 
- one to one or one to many 
- isolates vs connected hardware IoT vs accessory
