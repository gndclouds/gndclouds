_A playlist is a collection of examples to quickly onboard to a concept. _

With the increased accessibility of home automation by the use of mainstream IoT products and the squad + community isolation, I have started to explore new methods of ways to use hardware to explore connectedness. The range of how ambient hardware is defined is rather wide-ranging as seen in [these exameles](https://www.are.na/gndclouds/ambient-hardware).
