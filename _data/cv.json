    "description": "During the Summer of 2014 a team of interns (Juan Correa & Rucha Patwardhan and I) worked on researching how we could make Intel's Galileo more approachable to novice makers. We were apart of Intel Labs User Experience Research Group and more specifically, the Open Design Research Team. Our goal was to deliver a comprehensive research summary of the space surrounding Galileo and a final prototype of our recommended solution. Our team conducted a comprehensive research phase focusing on building an eco system surrounding the Galileo to enable it to become an educational platform for individuals new to the maker space.",
