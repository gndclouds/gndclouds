Over the last month I have been reworking how I filter the media sources I listen to, watch, and read. Normally I read a mix of information friends send me, links in feedly, newsletters, podcasts, online communities.

It's tiring to track all these sources and to [keep them organized](blog.gndclouds.cc/personal-information-system-v3)



At the beginning of 2020 I started using Feedly's Leo AI to help find media related to topics I was researching but I have since overhauled the way I have Leo filter data.
