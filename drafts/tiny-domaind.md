# Why do we have Namebase Tokens?

Early in 2020 we took on some client work to help extend our runway for transatioing to being creatively indepents at Tiny Factories. Our client offered us a mix or USD and Tokens for our work which we accepted

Now at the beginning of September 2020 we have ))) domains and Namebase has announced that they will help with the setup of a Top Level Domain (TLD).

The current thinking is that we will start [Tiny Domains](https://domains.tinyfactories.space) and apply the revenue

# How much will this help fun Tiny Factories?

There are a few elemnts for pricing which are out of our control

If we take .milktea for example, if we lease the domain for 1 year at 20 to 200 tea shops around the world that about \$4000 a year to put towads prkec

If there are any of our domains which you would like to see us move into the TLD space please let me know!
